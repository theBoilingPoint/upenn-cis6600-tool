## Introduction
The development of Terroder, a terrain creation tool, is a response to a distinct need within the realm of digital environment design. Inspired by the work of [Schott et al.](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3592787), Terroder is aimed at addressing three key criteria often overlooked by existing terrain generation tools: producing realistic and detailed output at a micro-scale, allowing for nuanced user control, and maximizing efficiency in terms of user effort. The prevalent terrain generation tools frequently fall short in one or more of these areas, either by limiting the level of detail achievable, restricting user control, or necessitating extensive manual effort for detail refinement.
